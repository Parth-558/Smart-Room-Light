# Smart-Room-Light
An intelligent LED light control system using Arduino, LDR, PIR, and smooth fading.
An intelligent lighting system using **LDR**, **PIR**, **manual override**, and **millis()-based LED fading**. Built with Arduino Uno and simulated in Tinkercad.

## ðŸ”§ Features

* **Automatic LED control** based on light level (LDR) and motion (PIR)
* **Smooth LED fade-in/out** using `analogWrite()` and `millis()`
* **Manual override** using push-button
* **Status LED** for idle state (dim glow)
* **Intrusion alert** via buzzer if sudden light drop + motion detected
* **Auto shutoff** after 2 minutes of no motion
